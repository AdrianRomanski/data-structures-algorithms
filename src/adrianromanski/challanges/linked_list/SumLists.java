package adrianromanski.challanges.linked_list;
// Challenge: You have two numbers represented by a linked list.
// Each node represents a single digit, in reverse order, such that the
// 1's digit is at the head. Write a function that adds the two numbers
// and returns the sum as a linked list.

// Example
// Input:  (8 -> 2 -> 5) + (4 -> 9 -> 2). That is 528 + 294.
// Output: (2 -> 2 -> 8). That is 822.
